Those directories/folders are:

CODE where are the main templates. 

EXAMPLES a bunch of tiny examples of generative sonic design.

RECS all live sets can be recorded with the start.rec / stop.rec buttons that appears in the bottom section of the 音 Core’s Rack  (block which contains FX, signal sends and main clock). 
Those recordings used with 音 Core will be stored in the RECS folder.

Additionally you can create a new folder in the same level for example ‘Projects’ or the name you want, in order to store your apps and at the same time keep the Recording function.
